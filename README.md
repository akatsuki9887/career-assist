Career Assist
Career Assist is a web application designed to help job seekers identify their skill gaps, match with relevant jobs, and create a personalized learning plan to bridge those gaps. By analyzing a user's resume, it extracts skills, matches them with job requirements, and provides a structured roadmap with resources and projects to learn missing skills. Built with a modern tech stack, it combines a Python backend with a React frontend for a seamless user experience.
